# mandatory_assignment_2
Repo for the 2nd mandatory assignment of Problem Sovling with Scripting

- Added an extra class (Contact), and the list of contacts is now called ContactList. 
- Added regex in the input handling of the contact information. 

Main problems remains:
- How do I make the messages send out at the correct time?
- How do I make this into a package?
